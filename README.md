# AGENT - WP5 and WP6 repository
The repository serves the purpose of joint development and a sharing platform amongst the workpackage 5 and 6 in the **AGENT** project. 

## Workpackage 5:
#### Objectives of Workpackage 5: 
- O5.1: Develop and implement guidelines and formats for data production, exchange and representation.
- O5.2: Support a FAIR data federation for wheat/barley GenRes.
- O5.3: Provide an integrated communication interface between GB, EURISCO and other data archives.

#### Tasks of Workpackage 5: 
- Task 5.1: Establish guidelines for dataflow from production to publication.
- Task 5.2: Specification of the formats required for data representation and exchange.
- Task 5.3: Facilitating data curation and exchange of data compliant with the FAIR principles in AGENTâ€™s data infrastructure.

## Workpackage 6:
#### Objectives of Workpackage 6: 
- O6.1: Develop an infrastructure to manage and analyse genotypic and phenotypic data.
- O6.2: Support the active, integrated management of genetic resources (GenRes) by genebanks (GB).
- O6.3: Empower users of GenRes to identify material of interest with accuracy and precision.
- O6.4: Provide a modelling environment allowing researchers and breeders to test new accessions against reference data.

#### Tasks of Workpackage 6: 
- Task 6.1: Development of an open infrastructure for the management of genotypic and phenotypic data.
- Task 6.2: Development of a Portable set of Interoperable Tools for Analysis and Predictive Modelling of Genetic Resources
- Task 6.3: Enhancement of EURISCO with new tools for data discovery and visualization.
